# n8n Workflow Automation — Self-Study Roadmap

**Source:** `19-n8n-workflows.md` · **Phase 1** · Cleaned & annotated

## Overview

n8n is a visual automation tool for connecting apps without code. Drag-and-drop "nodes" onto a canvas, connect them, and your spreadsheet talks to your email, your CRM talks to Slack, your AI talks to everything. Open-source, self-hostable, scales from simple triggers to complex business logic with custom code.

## Core Content

### 1. The Elevator Pitch

Digital plumbing: you drag-and-drop nodes, connect them with lines, and apps start talking. Open-source, free to self-host, and grows from simple "when this, do that" to complex business logic. Like Zapier but you own it.

### 2. Why This Matters

- **Unfair advantage:** Automate 80% of boring work in minutes. Build systems that run while you sleep.
- **Hidden leverage:** Every workflow is a reusable asset. 15 minutes of setup saves 15 minutes every single day forever.
- **"Aha!" moment:** Most "integration problems" are data transformation problems in disguise. When you see JSON flow between nodes and realize you can bend it to your will, you become an architect.

### 3. Reality Check

- **Overrated when:** You only need 2 simple apps connected — Zapier/IFTTT is faster and cheaper.
- **Opportunity cost:** Learning n8n vs. Python scripting, API fundamentals, or database querying. You can get far without knowing REST APIs, but when things break, that knowledge gap hurts.
- **Not for:** People who hate visual interfaces, teams needing enterprise SLA support, anyone who wants to skip "thinking through logic."

### 4. Core Concepts

| Concept | What It Does | Analogy |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Triggers** | Event that starts workflow | Motion sensor turning on a light |
| **Nodes** | One job per node | Assembly line stations |
| **Data Flow** | JSON passed between nodes | Water treatment plant |
| **Logic Gates** | IF/THEN branches | Traffic cop directing cars |
| **Error Handling** | Safety net for failures | Circuit breakers |
| **Self-Hosting** | Run on your own server | Own car vs. rental |

### 5. AI Leverage

**Use AI for:** Workflow design before touching n8n, JSON debugging, template generation, explaining node configurations.

**Don't outsource:** Understanding your business logic, testing edge cases, debugging production failures (AI can help interpret, but you need to understand data flow).

**One AI workflow:** *"I want to build an n8n workflow that [goal]. Give me the node sequence, JSON data structure between nodes, and 3 edge cases that could break this."*

### 6. Learning Map

| Phase | Time | Goal |
|-------|------|------|
| **Hook** | 15 min | Build a "Welcome Email" workflow: form submission → send email. See data flow A to B. |
| **Foundation** | 1 hr | 3 principles: JSON is the language (read Input/Output tabs); triggers vs. actions; the Set node is your best friend |
| **Application** | 1–2 hr | Build "Lead Scoring & Routing": webhook → Set → IF → Slack/Sheet/email on failure |
| **Deep Dive** | Optional | Self-host with Docker, custom JS/TS nodes, LangChain AI integration, sub-workflows |

### 7. Go/No-Go

| Situation | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| Automate across apps without coding | 🟢 **Learn this NOW** |
| Deep programming skills first | ⏳ Learn Python/APIs first |
| 1–2 simple automations only | 🟡 Consider Zapier |
| Enterprise compliance, 24/7 support | 🔴 n8n is community-supported unless enterprise |
| Team with non-technical staff | 🟢 **Learn this NOW** — visual interface shines |
| Limited budget, unlimited ambition | 🟢 **Learn this NOW** — self-hosted is free forever |
| AI-powered automations (RAG, agents) | 🟢 **Learn this NOW** — LangChain integration |

## Key Takeaways

1. **JSON is the language of n8n** — learn to read the Input/Output tabs and you can debug anything.
2. The Set node is the most important tool — master reshaping data mid-workflow.
3. Self-hosting is free forever but comes with infrastructure responsibility. Use n8n Cloud until you hit limits.
4. Error handling is not optional — one broken node kills the whole workflow without it.
