# Writing Efficient Python Code

**Source:** `10-efficient-python.md` · **Phase 1** · Cleaned & annotated

## Overview

Efficient Python isn't genius — it's knowing which built-in tool to reach for instead of reinventing the wheel. Use the right data structures (sets, dicts) and patterns (comprehensions, generators), and code runs 10× faster, uses less memory, and is shorter to read.

## Core Content

### 1. The Elevator Pitch

Python already has optimized solutions for 90% of common tasks. Your job: stop writing manual loops and start using built-ins, comprehensions, and the right data structures. Result: code that runs faster, uses less memory, and is actually easier to read.

### 2. Why This Matters

- **Unfair advantage:** Solve problems faster with less code. While others write 20-line loops, you write one-line comprehensions.
- **Hidden leverage:** These habits compound. Once you internalize "use built-ins first," every script gets faster automatically.
- **"Aha!" moment:** "The loop I just wrote is probably already a built-in function." That realization eliminates 80% of inefficient beginner code.

### 3. Reality Check

- **Overrated when:** Scripts that run once on 100 rows. Premature optimization is a trap.
- **Opportunity cost:** Micro-optimizing vs. learning data structures, APIs, or debugging skills with higher career ROI.
- **Not for:** Absolute day-1 beginners still struggling with syntax. Learn to make it work first.

### 4. Core Concepts

| Technique | What It Does | Analogy |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Built-ins over loops** | `max()`, `sum()`, `any()` exist for a reason | Highway vs. building your own road |
| **List comprehensions** | `[x*2 for x in nums]` runs at C-speed internally | Hand-crank vs. electric drill |
| **Sets/Dicts for lookups** | O(1) membership testing vs. O(n) for lists | Phone book page-by-page vs. search bar |
| **Generators** | Process 10GB file line-by-line, not all in RAM | Netflix vs. downloading the whole season |
| **Move work out of loops** | Compile regex / get `datetime.now()` once | Don't recalculate route at every intersection |
| **Join strings, don't append** | `"".join(list)` instead of `+=` in a loop | Rewriting a letter to add one sentence |

### 5. AI Leverage

**Use AI for:** Pasting ugly code and asking "Is there a built-in or comprehension that replaces this?" — AI is great at pattern-matching to Pythonic alternatives.

**Don't outsource:** The intuition of when to use generator vs. list — you need to feel the pain of a memory crash to understand why it matters.

**One AI workflow:** *"Here's my Python function [paste]. Rewrite it using only built-in functions and the most efficient data structures. Explain why each change is faster."* Then `timeit` both versions.

### 6. Learning Map

| Phase | Time | Goal |
|-------|------|------|
| **Hook** | 15 min | Learn `sum()`, `max()`, `any()`, `all()`, `enumerate()`. Replace one manual loop. |
| **Foundation** | 1 hr | 3 principles: built-ins are C-speed (your loop can't beat them); data structure choice > clever algorithms; readability still wins |
| **Application** | 1–2 hr | Process a 10K+ row CSV three ways: naive loops → comprehensions → generators. `timeit` and compare memory. |
| **Deep Dive** | Optional | `itertools`, `functools`, `collections` modules. "Fluent Python". |

### 7. Go/No-Go

| Situation | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| Write Python scripts processing >1K items or run repeatedly | 🟢 **Learn this NOW** |
| Still googling "how to write a for loop" | 🔴 Skip — learn syntax first |
| Shipping fast > code elegance | 🟡 Learn just Phase 1 (built-ins) |
| Python for tiny one-off data cleaning | 🟡 Learn list comprehensions only |
| Coding interview in <1 week | 🟢 Sets/dicts for lookups + comprehensions |
| Working with massive files (logs, datasets) | 🟢 **Prioritize generators** |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Built-ins are written in C** — your Python loop will never beat `max()` or `sum()`.
2. **The right data structure matters more than clever algorithms** — a set lookup is O(1), a list search is O(n).
3. **Generators are your lifeline for large data** — they make the impossible (10GB files) merely slow.
4. **Don't optimize what doesn't need it** — a script that runs once in 0.1s is fine. Know when to apply these patterns.
