# Practical Python Automation — 7 Everyday Scripts

**Source:** `18-python-automation.md` · **Phase 1** · Cleaned & annotated

## Overview

Python automation means writing tiny scripts that handle repetitive digital chores — sorting files, monitoring system health, sending emails, searching text. Spend 15 minutes writing a script once, save hours every week forever. Core idea: if you do it on a computer more than twice, automate it.

### 1. The Elevator Pitch

Hire a tireless intern who works for free and never complains. Instead of manually sorting files, monitoring your computer, or searching through folders, tiny scripts do it for you. Repetitive digital tasks should be handled by code, not by your brain.

### 2. Why This Matters

- **Unfair advantage:** Automators reclaim 5–10 hours per week that others lose to digital chores. They look like wizards.
- **Hidden leverage:** Each script makes the next one easier. Over a year, you go from "I can Google stuff" to "I built my own productivity OS."
- **"Aha!" moment:** "Boring work is just a script I haven't written yet." When you catch yourself doing a repetitive task and think "I could automate this," your brain upgrades permanently.

### 3. Reality Check

- **Overrated when:** You spend more time building automation than the task would take. The "automate everything" crowd falls into this trap.
- **Opportunity cost:** Python automation is a support skill, not a career destination. Data analysis, web dev, AI have clearer career paths.
- **Not for:** People who hate debugging, locked-down corporate machines, or those who genuinely enjoy manual organization.

### 4. Core Concepts (7 Scripts)

| Script | What It Does | Why Care |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **File Organizer** | Sorts Downloads folder by extension | Visual chaos drains focus |
| **System Monitor** | Alerts before crash | Prevents "why is everything slow?" distractions |
| **Email Automation** | Sends recurring updates | Mental weight lifted |
| **Desktop Notifications** | Gentle reminders | Willpower is a battery; reminders recharge |
| **Password Generator** | Creates unbreakable keys | "Forgot password" flows eat 10 min/week |
| **Text Search** | Ctrl+F for entire computer | Kills creative momentum to search |
| **Twitter Scraper** | Monitors for keywords | Being first matters for deadlines |

### 5. AI Leverage

**Use AI for:** Generating scripts from task descriptions, debugging error messages, extending scripts with new features.

**Don't outsource:** Understanding the logic (or you can't adapt it), security decisions (hardcoding passwords), judging what's worth automating.

**One AI workflow:** *"I spend 30 minutes every Friday organizing Downloads. Write me a Python script using pathlib and shutil that sorts files by extension. Explain each line like I'm a beginner."*

### 6. Learning Map

| Phase | Time | Goal |
|-------|------|------|
| **Hook** | 15 min | Run the File Organizer on your Downloads. Watch 200 files sort in 2 seconds. |
| **Foundation** | 1 hr | 3 principles: `os`/`pathlib` are file remotes; libraries extend power; automation without scheduling is a party trick |
| **Application** | 1–2 hr | Build a "Weekly Cleanup Bot": File Organizer + System Monitor + notification. Run every Sunday night. |
| **Deep Dive** | Optional | `schedule` library, `watchdog` for real-time monitoring, "Automate the Boring Stuff" book |

### 7. Go/No-Go

| Situation | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| Stop doing repetitive computer tasks | 🟢 **Learn this NOW** |
| Building apps or analyzing data | ⏳ Come back later as support skill |
| Locked-down work machine | ⚠️ Use Google Apps Script or Power Automate instead |
| Already use Hazel/AutoHotkey | 🟡 Python gives more control but may not need it |
| Portfolio piece for non-tech people | 🟢 **Learn this NOW** ("I built a robot") |
| Zero coding, want job in 3 months | 🔴 Learn web dev or data analysis instead |

## Key Takeaways

1. **If you do it on a computer more than twice, automate it.** That's the threshold for ROI.
2. The File Organizer script is the perfect first project — immediate, visual, satisfying.
3. Automation without scheduling is a party trick — learn `cron` (Mac/Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
4. Python automation is a support skill that compounds across everything else you do.
