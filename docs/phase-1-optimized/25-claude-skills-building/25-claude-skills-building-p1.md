# Claude Skills Building

**Source:** `25-claude-skills-building.md` · **Phase 1** · Cleaned & annotated

## Overview

Claude Skills are reusable instruction packs you build once and Claude loads automatically when relevant. Instead of pasting the same style guide, workflow, or quality checklist into every chat, you write it into a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter. The AI reads the description to decide if the skill applies, loads the full instructions when needed, and references extra files only on demand.

## Core Content

### 1. The Elevator Pitch

Claude Skills are teaching Claude your job once, then having it remember forever. You write instructions into a structured file with trigger conditions, step-by-step directions, and quality checks. Claude loads it automatically when the conversation matches the trigger description. No more repeating yourself.

### 2. Why This Matters

- **Unfair advantage:** Every conversation starts at full speed instead of spending 5 minutes re-establishing context. Consistent output without anyone memorizing a style guide.
- **Hidden leverage:** Skills compound like software libraries. Build one for blog writing, one for code review, one for onboarding. Each makes every future task faster.
- **"Aha!" moment:** Claude doesn't forget -- but only if you write it down. A skill is just "what you would tell a new hire" encoded in a file.

### 3. Reality Check

- **Overrated when:** You only use Claude for one-off questions. The overhead of maintaining a skill folder isn't worth casual use.
- **Opportunity cost:** Writing instructions for AI is slower than doing the task itself -- until you do that task 10+ times. The break-even point is higher than most estimate.
- **Not for:** Irregular solo users, people who can't articulate their workflow clearly, anyone expecting skills to replace thinking.

### 4. Core Concepts

| Concept | Analogy | Why Care |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Restaurant menu -- you see categories first, not every recipe | Claude loads ~100 tokens per skill by default; full instructions only on demand |
| **Composability** | LEGO bricks snapping together | Multiple skills can load at once (blog-writing + SEO-checklist) |
| **Portability** | PDF that opens on any device | One skill works in Claude.ai, Claude Code, and the API |
| **Trigger Conditions** | Smart doorbell that only rings for the right visitor | Description field must include exact phrases. Vague descriptions = skill fails silently. |
| **Naming Rules** | Password -- one wrong character and nothing happens | SKILL.md is case-sensitive. No spaces in folder names. Claude gives zero error messages. |

### 5. AI Leverage

**Use AI for:** Drafting the `SKILL.md` from messy notes, generating test matrices (20 trigger phrases to test activation), converting existing docs into skill format, debugging silent failures.

**Don't outsource:** Defining the use case (what does your team actually need?), writing the quality checklist (domain-specific standards), deciding trigger phrases (you know what your team actually says).

**One AI workflow:** *"I need a skill for [specific task]. Here are my notes: [paste]. Convert this into a proper SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter, step-by-step instructions, a quality checklist, and 10 test trigger phrases."*

### 6. Learning Map

| Phase | Time | Goal |
|-------|------|------|
| **Hook** | 15 min | Create a folder with `SKILL.md`, basic YAML frontmatter, and 3 lines of instructions. Test it in Claude.ai. |
| **Foundation** | 1 hr | Trigger specificity, progressive disclosure (references/, assets/), self-verification (quality checklist) |
| **Application** | 1-2 hr | Build a real skill for something you do repeatedly. Include frontmatter, examples, troubleshooting, references. Test with 5 inputs. |
| **Deep Dive** | Optional | MCP-enhanced skills, organization-wide distribution, Skills API, agentskills.io standard |

### 7. Go/No-Go Matrix

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| I do the same task in Claude 3+ times per week | Learn this NOW |
| I lead a team that needs consistent AI output | Learn this NOW |
| I have no repeatable workflows to encode | Skip entirely |
| I have 15 minutes and want to feel smarter | Do Phase 1 only |
| I want to distribute skills to my organization | Learn distribution + Phase 3 |

> [!TIP] The 80/20: write one good `SKILL.md` with specific triggers and a quality checklist. That captures 80% of the value.

## Key Takeaways

- Skills are reusable instruction packs loaded automatically based on trigger conditions in the YAML description.
- Progressive disclosure means Claude reads ~100 tokens per skill by default; full instructions load only when relevant.
- The #1 failure mode is vague trigger descriptions -- be specific and test 10+ variations.
- Naming is strict: `SKILL.md` (case-sensitive), no spaces in folder names, no README.md inside.
- Skills amplify clarity; they don't create it. If you can't explain your process to a human, you can't encode it for Claude.
